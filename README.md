# A generational tale, told in video game form

Dolomite Joe was created in **one week** for the University at Buffalo Game Development Club's (UBGD) 2024 Halloween Game Jam.
The theme was "automation", and one of the bonus themes was "rocks". From this, my narrative masterwork was created.

Dolomite Joe sees a local family rock farmer (named Dolomite Joe) fighting against the takeover of his farmland from a malevolent force with a "Synthetic Rock Machine", threatening his family's business as well as the rock farming industry as a whole.

The core gameplay involves text based "negotiation" segments with various prominent members of the rock industry. This involves a classic "pick the right conversation options" section, a game where you must tell the difference between real and synthetic rocks, and a historical trivia section!

This is also my first project that features my trademark Microsoft Paint artwork and animations. Get used to it, because it's in **ALL OF THEM** from this point on.

# Some technical notes

This is the first game that I've made in a time limit, and it shows in the code. It's not elegant at all, but DOES work not too terribly.

You may notice that file organization improved *very slightly*. The reason for this being that I stored animation frames in their own files. I'm slowly approaching better organization
